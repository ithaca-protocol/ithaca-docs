# Introduction

Ithaca is a cross-chain derivatives trading and settlements protocol. It is a hybrid protocol composed of an on-chain settlement layer and an innovative off-chain matching engine.&#x20;

### Why is Ithaca Disruptive?

Traditionally, derivative instruments on the same underlying clear in independent markets, usually, not only in digital assets, on different exchanges, with all the concomitant operational, counterparty, funding risk implications. Margin loan and funding markets are also operating independently. Liquidity across these markets is fragmented by definition and gets delivered by market participants that extract the value associated with providing these liquidity pooling services across instruments, venues and market structure arrangements.

Specifically:

1. Traders, arbitrageurs, market makers broadly, enforce the linkages between independent markets
2. Traders of listed derivatives, funding repo, 1 delta products extract revenue associated with spot vs vanilla options delta hedging at inception, lifetime, expiry as well as creating implied ‘OTC equivalent‘ markets on funding rates, collateral posting and collateral swaps
3. Structured products and associated structuring efforts and intermediaries managing internally option path dependence and binary/barrier risk and earning the associated high margins

The Ithaca matching engine leverages Frequent Batch Auctions (FBAs). In FBAs, time is treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders are processed in auction batches instead of serially. This eliminates front-running and creates a uniform clearing price.  By utilizing FBAs to clear derivatives, we can **decompose the clearing of financial contracts into packages of ‘atomic’ instruments**, using **put-call parity** relationships. This enables order matching at the atomic instrument level, and for ‘synthetic’ orders to be formed via replication principles involving multiple interdependent legs.



### Mission

1. Build permissionless blockchain-based cross-chain infrastructure that enables optimal risk sharing across time and states of the world for any digital representation of value.
2. Embed ourselves at all steps of the lifecycle of any risk sharing instrument; conceptualization and structuring, trading, risk management and distribution, on- / off-chain bridging and settlement; trustless protocol governance

### The Ithaca Ecosystem encompasses

* an option trading protocol
* an algorithmic market maker;
* a verifiable collateral optimization and liquidation engine

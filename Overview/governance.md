## Protocol Governance 

IME involves methodological advances that are beyond the current capacity of the Ethereum blockchain, L2 scaling solutions as well as the Polygon sidechain, requiring calculations with too high time and space complexity to run on-chain. 

## Governance Deliverables 

- Trustless contract upgrade & maintenance framework;
- Ethereum transaction ledger monitoring & reporting
- Back end instance calculation verification

Decision making framework for

- Supported Underlyings 
- blockchain deployment & scalability protocol choices
- exogenous matching engine setup parameters;
    - min margin / expiry dynamics / strikes & expiries / VAR & VAR multiples / MIP runtime cutoff  / liquidation parameters
- Fees, licensing
- Incentive mechanism for Static Conditional Hedge Path dependent payoffs
